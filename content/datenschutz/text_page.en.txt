The information generated by the cookie about your use of the website is usually transmitted to and stored by Google on servers in the United States. Should IP-anonymization be activated on this website, Google will first truncate your IP address within the area of Member States of the European Union or other parties to the Agreement on the European Economic Area. Only in exceptional cases will the whole IP address first be transferred to a Google server in the USA and truncated there. Google will use this information on behalf of the operator of this website for the purpose of evaluating your use of the website, to compile reports on website activity for website operators and to provide them with other services relating to website activity and internet usage.</p>

<p><strong>(4)</strong>&nbsp;This website uses Google Analytics with the extension “_anonymizeIp()”. This means that IP addresses are processed in a truncated fashion; this prevents the identification of any individual person.
