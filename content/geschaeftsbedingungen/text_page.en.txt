These general terms and conditions cover the use of the services provided by S&amp;P HEALTHCARE SERVICES, Cornelia Toussaint, Dohnaer Str. 73, 01219 Dresden, (subsequently referred to as: “S&amp;P” or “contractor”). They govern the conclusion of a contract between the company, which makes use of the services offered (“client”) and S&amp;P and the execution of contracts agreed; they also inform both parties of their respective mutual rights and obligations under the contract.</p><p>1.2.&nbsp;The business relationship between S&amp;P and the client is regulated exclusively by these General terms and conditions together with the data privacy regulations and the terms agreed by S&amp;P and the client for each “individual order” or “consultancy agreement”. In cases of doubt, these individual terms have priority over the General terms and conditions. S&amp;P does not accept any deviating conditions imposed by the client, unless they have given their express (written) agreement to them.</p><p>1.3. S&amp;P can alter these General terms and conditions at any time with effect for the future. In such a case, S&amp;P will inform the client of the changed conditions and highlight the changes clearly. If the client is not in agreement with these changes, he can object to them within four weeks of receipt of the notification of change. Should the client not lodge any objection within this period, the client has accepted the changes. If the client should object to the changes, the contract will remain in force, but S&amp;P may make use of its ordinary right of termination. S&amp;P will inform the client of their right of objection, the meaning of the behaviour of the client and the resulting legal consequences separately in the communication.</p>"

The client is obliged to inform S&amp;P about the “red hand” letter immediately. If this involves notification of previously unknown and/or more serious side effects, S&amp;P will cease the provision of services for the applicable product immediately after learning of these developments; if this agreement covers further products not affected by the DHCP <em>(“Rote Hand</em>”) &nbsp;letter, its provisions retain their validity. In such cases, S&amp;P is entitled to complete payment for the whole service pertaining to the corresponding product(s) as foreseen in the individual order without the client acquiring the right to require S&amp;P to perform the foreseen service.</p>"
