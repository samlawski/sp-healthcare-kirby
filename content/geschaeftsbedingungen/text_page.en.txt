They govern the conclusion of a contract between the company, which makes use of the services offered (“client”) and S&amp;P and the execution of contracts agreed; they also inform both parties of their respective mutual rights and obligations under the contract.</p><p>1.2 The business relationship between S&amp;P and the client is regulated exclusively by these General terms and conditions together with the data privacy regulations and the terms agreed by S&amp;P and the client for each “individual order”. In cases of doubt, these individual terms have priority over the General terms and conditions. S&amp;P does not accept any deviating conditions imposed by the client, unless they have given their express (written) agreement to them.</p><p>1.3 S&amp;P can alter these General terms and conditions at any time with effect for the future. In such a case, S&amp;P will inform the client of the changed conditions and highlight the changes clearly. If the client is not in agreement with these changes, he can object to them within four weeks of receipt of the notification of change. Should the client not lodge any objection within this period, the client has accepted the changes. If the client should object to the changes, the contract will remain in force, but S&amp;P may make use of its ordinary right of termination. S&amp;P will inform the client of their right of objection, the meaning of the behaviour of the client and the resulting legal consequences separately in the communication.</p>"

The respective contact partners of the client and S&P for pharmaceutical and technical matters are recorded in the individual order.</p>\n\n<p>4.2. The contractual relationship between S&P and the client begins once the individual order for which these General terms and conditions apply, has been signed.</p>\n\n<p>4.3. The start and duration of the commissioned performance is defined by the agreements concluded within the relevant individual order.</p>\n\n<p>4.4. The duration of the contract is defined by the term of the booked services selected by the client and recorded in the individual order, supplemented by any contractual obligations still to be performed by the parties to the agreement after the end of the duration of the agreement.</p>\n\n<p>4.5. The agreement will end with the successful communication of all information to the client or with the last payment to S&P, whichever of the two is the later event.</p>\n\n<p>4.6. S&P can take advantage of its ordinary right of termination with a deadline of 4 (four) weeks to the end of the month, in cases where a client has objected to the receipt of the notification of changes in accordance figure 1.3. Otherwise, the parties cannot make use of ordinary termination.</p>\n\n<p>4.7. The legal right to termination of this agreement on grounds of good cause with a shorter or even no deadline remains unaffected. Good cause includes for example:</p>\n\n<p>4.7.1. If the client is in arrears with the payment of due fees.</p>\n\n<p>4.7.2. If one or both of the parties infringes applicable law or these general terms and conditions, especially specifications pertaining to data protection and other expressly agreed obligations.</p>\n\n<p>4.8. The termination must be issued in writing (e-mail is sufficient).</p>\n\n<p>4.9. The consequences of the termination:</p>\n\n<p>4.9.1. Once the termination has taken force, both parties are no longer required to perform the contractual services, unless an express agreement to the contrary has been entered or this results from the nature of the service or agreement.</p>\n\n<p>4.9.2. The client is required to remunerate any services performed by S&P up to the point at which the termination takes effect and which have not yet been remunerated.</p>\n\n<p>4.9.3. S&P will submit all information collected up to the point of the termination and not yet made available to the client pertaining to visits to the doctors and pharmacies within 6 (six) weeks, together with the information documentation and samples in the possession of S&P. Figs. 6.6 and 6.9 apply accordingly.</p>\n\n<p>04:10. Both parties are aware of the possibility that the client can send and/or publish a “DHCP letter” during the duration of the contract in consultation with the federal supervisory authority (BfArM or Paul-Ehrlich-Institut) responsible for the respective pharmaceutical product and concerning one or more of the products involved in the individual order. The client is obliged to inform S&P about the “DHCP letter” immediately. If this involves notification of previously unknown and/or more serious side effects, S&P will cease the provision of services for the applicable product immediately after learning of these developments; if this agreement covers further products not affected by the DHCP letter, its provisions retain their validity. In such cases, S&P is entitled to complete payment for the whole service pertaining to the corresponding product(s) as foreseen in the individual order without the client acquiring the right to require S&P to perform the foreseen service.</p>"

S&P obliges the HCR to store the samples provided by the client in cool, dry and hygienic conditions, protected from access by third parties in lockable rooms. The temperature of the storage room must lie between 15° - 25° Celsius; transgressions of this specification to 8° and 27° are acceptable.</p>\n\n<p>6.5.

S&P will conclude a contract with the HCRs which oblige them not to take any medicines for their own consumption or to pass medicines on to third parties apart from the doctors / pharmacists which they visit.</p>\n\n<p>6.8. S&P will transmit information pertaining to the doctors / pharmacists visited by the HCRs to an e-mail address stipulated by the client at the interval and in the scope specified by the client in their individual order.</p>\n\n<p>6.9. S&P will send an overview of all the results to the client by e-mail or on a USB flash drive. This will be sent 4 (four) weeks after the end of the duration of the contract specified in the individual order.</p>\n\n<p>06:10.
